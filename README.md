# ngc2141
I made multiple night observations on the target NGC 2141 open cluster at HRPO 20-inch telescope (Baton Rouge, LA). 

Data: 
- R Filter: 14 CCD images
- V Filter: 10 CCD images
The images have already been processed using ISIS package, a complete package to process CCD images using the image subtraction method (http://www2.iap.fr/users/alard/package.html).

I performed photometry for stars of the cluters, detected 112 stars that are 300 pixels away from the center of the cluster, and determined the stars' pixels using the watershed algorithm, taking into account the overlapping fluxes of 2 nearby stars. 
Finally, with further refinement methods, I created HR diagram for stars detected in the clusters and further the light curve to measure the distance of the cluster.
